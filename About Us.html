            <h1>How we prepare Jaggary in our Farm. </h1>
            <p class="stylish-text">
                1.	Organically grown, fully matured sugarcane is harvested from the Hatti Organic Farm.
                2.	Organic sugarcane is crushed through clean horizontal three roller crusher. 
                3.	Our Sugarcane juice usually have brix more than 20° and pH around 5.3 for quality jaggery production. 
                4.	Coarsely filtered juice is taken into clean open pan for boiling.
                5.	Clarification of sugarcane juice in organic jaggery production is made through application of “okra plant stalk extract” and “lime solution” in fresh juice for raising pH of sugarcane juice.
                6.	Around 85°C temperature of juice, black scum appears on the top and it is removed by sieve. 
                7.	Further juice is continuously heated and stirred. Scum and impurities are removed as when it appears on the top. 
                8.	Above 100 °C temperature of juice, olive oil is applied to avoid caramelation of juice. 
                9.	Jaggery stage is attained at juice striking temperature of 118°-120°C. Jaggery is shifted to cooling Pan and allowed to cool by stirring by scraper. 
                10.	It is then filled into moulds before its temperature goes below 76 °C. After complete cooling jaggery is taken out of moulds and allow to dry. 
                1)	Dried jaggery (moisture content less than 7 %) is then packed in to suitable packaging material.
